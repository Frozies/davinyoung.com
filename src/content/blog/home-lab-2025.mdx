Every engineer needs a lab. Here's mine.

## The Hardware

Nothing fancy — two refurbished Dell OptiPlex machines and a Raspberry Pi 4:

- **Node 1** (OptiPlex 7060): Primary Docker host, 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe
- **Node 2** (OptiPlex 5070): Secondary host + database server, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD + 2TB HDD
- **Pi 4**: DNS (Pi-hole), monitoring dashboards

## The Stack

### Networking: Tailscale + Traefik

Tailscale gives me a mesh VPN across all nodes with zero port forwarding. Every service is accessible via `*.tail.net` addresses from any of my devices.

Traefik sits in front of everything as a reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (Traefik)
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v3
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.tlschallenge=true"
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./certs:/certs
```

### CI/CD: Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runners

I run self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on Node 1. This gives me faster builds (no cold starts) and the ability to deploy directly to my local infrastructure:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

### Services I Self-Host

- **Gitea** — Git server (mirror of my GitHub repos)
- **Uptime Kuma** — Monitoring and status page
- **Postgres** — Shared database for various projects
- **Nginx** — Static site hosting for experiments

## Why Bother?

A home lab isn't about saving money on cloud hosting. It's about understanding infrastructure at a deeper level. When you've debugged a Traefik routing issue at 2am, you understand reverse proxies differently than someone who just reads the docs.

It's also a great testing ground. Every new tool I evaluate for work gets tested here first.
